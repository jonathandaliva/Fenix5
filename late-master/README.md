# almost late! Garmin fēnix 3 Connect IQ watchface

![concept teaser](/doc/tease.png) 

* you rarely need to know an exact hour and minute in the day
* you rather need to know what is a current hour quickly (here digital watches are great)
* ...and get a sense of where you are within the hour (here analog watches are great)
* this concept combines the best from both worlds

Based on a [design concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33752138/Smart-watch-face-navigating-through-the-day) optimizing watch for daily usabilty. 
Availabe in [Garmin Connect IQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/3532114a-c93c-447a-bc8e-25999ea599fc).
 
 If you can contribute to show calendar events in the watchface, that would be awesome! 

## Special thanks
* To Diego Fernandez Bravo: Thank you for sharing your code which was base to this watch face
